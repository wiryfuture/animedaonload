# animedaonload
Basically i got bored and decided to improve a tampermonkey script i found for AD (https://github.com/tzubertowski/animeda-jt-o) for a download button but i basically rewrit it so here it is in its own repo.
# Installation
Install tampermonkey and then go to the file in this repo and then click install.
# Usage
Mate just press the download button under the player you silly sod. 
It'll open a new tab and then either prompt you where to save and what to call it, or download it in your default download location using the episode title as the filename.
